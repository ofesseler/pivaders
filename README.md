A Space Invaders clone written in Python and Pygame for the Raspberry Pi.

The original challenge was to write a playable and challenging re-make in around 300 lines of code (v0.1). 

This project was created by Russell Barnes for [Linux User & Developer magazine](http://linuxuser.co.uk) issue 136 (v0.1) and for a follow-up article in issue 137 (v.0.2) which added animation and sound.
